Notes on ARM64

SANDBOX: https://cpulator.01xz.net/
  ^ Using: ARMv7 DE1-SoC

LINKS:

  system call table: https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/docs/+/master/constants/syscalls.md

REGISTERS:

r7    -   stores information about system requests 
            ^ e.g. put a system Call Number (e.g. 1 = "terminate program") into r7 and then call an interrupt 
              ^=> operating system checks lookup table, completes task.
sp    -   "Stack Pointer" = the next space in Stack memory  
lr    -   "Link Register" = stores the location a function should return back to
pc    -   "Program Counter" = keeps track of the next instruction to execute
cpsr  -   used to store info about program 
            ^ e.g.  if subtract 2 nums, maybe negative. 
                    If use negative, in binary, need to use Two's Complement.
                    ^ But maybe positive. but how know if binary is - or + ?
                    CPSR sets flag says "result of prev operation was negative"
                    ^ can then use that information to handle data

SYNTAX:

    operator destination, source/address/immediate

BASIC PROGRAM:

    DEFAULT 2 lines ESSENTIAL:

        .global _start
        _start:

    ^ _start is a global Label that you can GOTO, and that label plus ":" is defining the nature of this label 

    MOVE NUMBER INTO REGISTER & KILL:

        .global _start
        _start:
          mov r0,#30
          mov r7,#1
          swi 0
    
    ^ here decimal 30, if Hex, 0x1e
    ^ terminate program; swi (software interrupt); OS reads r7; 1 is "terminate", end.
    ^ this returns "little endian" storage in r0 -- "0000001e" most sig bit on left.
      ^ ARM64 is bi-endian. Can reverse if xiang. 

    MOVING REGISTERS AROUND:

      mov r0, #5
      mov r1, r0
